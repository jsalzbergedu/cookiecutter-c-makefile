CookieCutter.el
===============

`cookiecutter.el` is a boilerplate template for simple one file emacs
lisp packages. It is experimental at the moment.

Usage
-----

You need to use
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter.git) which is a
commandline tool to create projects from templates. If you already use
cookiecutter you would know how to do this. Otherwise the following,
this will interactively ask some default settings for your package


    pip install cookiecutter
    cookiecutter https://github.com/theanalyst/cookiecutter-el.git
    cd your-project
    git init
